# graph-auto
A quick hack to test graph automorphism using ASP/SAT

A model in ASP that would be equivalent to a SAT model, so clasp should be similar to a normal SAT solver. 


Tested on instances from http://funkybee.narod.ru/graphs.htm


Here the results. 

```
for x in tests/*; do echo $(basename $x .graph) $(gringo3 model.lp $x | clasp --configuration=crafty -t 4 | grep 'SATIS\|CPU'); done
